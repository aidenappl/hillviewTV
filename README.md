# HillviewTV

I'm currently Part-Time teaching at Hillview Middle School and one of the biggest things that students, teachers, parents and the administration are always looking for is a central place for video content, Youtube wasn't working for them so this is a low level video archive for the school. 

This is an Angular project using a go backend for handling local auth, upload -> mediaconvert -> s3 and token issuance. Primarily using this as a testbed for video content delivery and upload handling while also going to support the school. Needed a low-level production test for costs, usage and scalability.

I challanged myself to get this entire stack done in one day, aiming to get it to a production ready state by 11/08 with periodic fixes, improvements, and changes past there. 

## Feedback

Let me know if you have any feedback on things I could do better with video handling. All code is open source to the community.
